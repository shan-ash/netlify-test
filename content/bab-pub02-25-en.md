### Various Writings – Selections from the Writings of the Bab – Baha’i Publishing Trust, Para (6:13), page 211

God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved.

Fix your gaze upon Him Whom God shall make manifest in the Day of Resurrection, then firmly believe in that which is sent down by Him.

Say, God hath undisputed triumph over every victorious one. There is no one in heaven or earth or in whatever lieth between them who can frustrate the transcendent supremacy of His triumph. He calleth into being whatsoever He willeth through the potency of His behest. Verily God is the mightiest Sustainer, the Helper and the Defender.
